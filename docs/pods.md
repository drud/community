# Pods

As an organization, we are continually exploring methods for working together to deliver the highest value we can for our customers while striving for efficiency and reducing toil internally. As we've grown and work with increasingly complex systems, we adjust our workflows to improve direction, visibility, and reduce the pressure of delivery to manageable levels for everyone involved.

The structure we currently follow borrows the concept of pods from the Kubernetes world and applies it to people. Pods should be reasonably autonomous but are required to share context with other pods through established communication interfaces.  Pods are created to perform a specific function and have no predefined lifetime, but generally, focus on quarterly objectives.

Each pod has a [objective](okr/introduction.md), and a pod leader responsible for aligning the pod's members to that [objective](okr/introduction.md) while sharing context that can be understood by other pods.
