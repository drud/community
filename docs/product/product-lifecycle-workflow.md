# Product Lifecycle Workflow

## Feature Requests
- Create an idea at [Aha](https://drud.aha.io/products/LIVE/ideas/new) or [send an email](mailto:ideas-LIVE-drud@mailer.aha.io). Include the following information when submitting an idea or feature request:
  - Give the feature request a good title.
  - Describe the customer or business need.
    - Example: Customers have their code stored in BitBucket, and they want to be able to launch sites directly from there.
    - Example: This would be nice to have by X date in the future because of a client opportunity.
    - Example: Not having this feature adds complexity or reduces stability for customers.
- Ideas are regularly triaged and may graduate into features and epics in the normal course.
## Product Lifecycle Workflow
- Define features in Aha with minimal information and share with the team.
- Create google doc to list use cases categorized as [must have, should have, could have or won't have (this time)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method).
- Link use case google doc from the aha feature.
- Populate a use case google doc with the desired use cases.
- Push the architecture team to evaluate initial use cases from a technical perspective.
- Agree on initial user stories weigthed with the [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method. Facilitate any conversations that need to happen.
- Decompose user stories into actionable github issues.
- Work with architecture team to create ADR pull requests where appropriate for initial concerns or direction.
- Request pod reviews ADR and adds appropriate detail before accepting and merging.
- Assist with necessary test plan changes or additions.
