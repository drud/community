# Out of the Office but Working Policy

"Out of the Office but Working" is our policy for communicating our work location when we plan to work outside of our home city for more than five hours. 

## Why is this a good idea?

- Collaboration/Transparency: Sharing your work location helps team members know where you are, and coordinate schedules for meetings, standups, etc. 
- Courtesy: Who really wants a Slack message alert at 3 AM local time?
- Safety: In the event of an emergency situation during work hours where you need our help, we’ll know where you are to assist you as best as we can.

## Who is required to post their time?

Everyone: Full-time employees, part-time employees, and full-time contractors 

## How do I post my time?

- Log in to [BambooHR](https://drud.bamboohr.com/) (at least three days prior to your departure)
- Click on "Request Time Off" 
- Input the dates that you will be working in another city
- Select "Out of the Office but Working" from the "Time off type" dropdown menu
- In the "Note" section type your City, State, and Country location and your anticipated work schedule (e.g., 8-5 Eastern Time)
- Click on "Send Request"
  - Your request will be routed to your manager for approval. This is more of an acknowledgment than approval. Keep in mind, if the team has an upcoming deadline, your manager may discuss your request with you given company priorities.
  - This does not get deducted from your paid time off (PTO) balance. It’s just a way to improve our communication, transparency, and collaboration.
- Double-check your Emergency Contact information in BambooHR to ensure it is current (Click on "My Info" in the top navigation, then select the "Emergency" tab)
