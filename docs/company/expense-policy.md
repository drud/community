# Expense Policy
## Expensify Travel Expenses
If you travel frequently you will be given access to Expensify to file expense reports. Please speak with your manager to request access.
## Non-Expensify Expense Request
DDEV wants to make every effort to get employees the tools they need in a timely manner.  We are rolling out this expense policy to easily request approval on tools, and services that need to be procured on behalf of the business.

For one time items totaling under $50.00, each employee shall have the discretion to order items as long as the item has 100% DDEV business purposes associated with it.  If you have been invited to use Expensify, due to the fact that you travel frequently, please go ahead and submit through Expensify.  If you don’t have an Expensify account through ddev, please use your own credit card to order and fill out a [manual expense report](https://forms.gle/jgYSfnGo19GDEfhg7). Please note if the tool replaces another SaaS tool that we are no longer using.

If the expense is greater than one time $50.00, or it is a SaaS subscription, it must be approved by your manager and the head of accounting in advance. Please fill out the enclosed form and accounting will route it for e-signature. Accounting will upload to PandaDocs and route it for e-signature. Please note if the tool replaces another SaaS tool that we are no longer using.  In an effort to consolidate expenses we will use the company CC where practical, so please don’t use your own personal CC.
