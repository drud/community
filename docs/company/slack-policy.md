# How we use Slack

- Questions/requests that need faster/same-day responses
- Activity coordination and intra-team reporting
- Real-time work conversations and async conversations for individuals outside of your timezone
- Social conversations

## What Slack shouldn't be used for

- Permanent source of record for High-level discussions
- Making and codifying decisions
  - Decisions and action items should be codified in a relevant tickets and systems of record

## General guidance 

- Default to public channels
- Proactive communications
- Don't forget context
- Fill out your Slack profile

  - This article is mostly about email, but it does offer great guidance on writing clearly, and effectively.

## Etiquette

- Be nice to one another
  - Don't infer tone, clear concise writing is hard, english isn't everyone's first language
  - If you're angry, take a break before hitting submit
  - If someone shares sensitive information via private message, they likely did for a reason. Make sure to get their consent before sharing it with a wider group
- Pay attention to time zones and be respectful of peoples' time
  - You can check someone's timezone in their profile
  - Use @here not @channel. The former pings all channel members who are currently online
    - Use your best judgement and consider the differences between the two

## Expectations around Slack availability

- Check Slack periodically throughout the day.
  - Participate in conversations as you have timeâ€”we do not expect instant responses
- You're responsible for managing your downtime
  - It's important that people can talk to each other even when the recipient is not around. If we're each responsible for our own down time (i.e. setting yourself up on Do Not Disturb when you're offline, not working, or in-the-zone; controlling notifications on your phone if you choose to install Slack there), we give the rest of the team full freedom to communicate as they like. It's your responsibility then to deal with the message when you're ready.
- Use statuses to communicate availability
- Kill/modify Slack when you need to focus
- When on a support rotation, actively monitor notifications in the #support and #cloud-ops channels.

## Expectations about team-mate responsiveness

- If you expect a response from someone, @ them, if you don't @ them, don't assume they will see your message (unless it's a DM, those notify immediately)
- Set time frames for when you need reply back
- You can expect a reply by the end of their normal workday
- You can join and leave channels as you wish
- If you need to escalate to another team or team-mate, ensure that urgency and criticality are understood and continue to escalate until they are understood
  - For instance, a casual mention of an issue in a general channel is not a proper escalation
  
## Slack Groups
You can ping specific department groups to alert the members in that group.

- **@admins** - Administrators that can assist with Slack related issues or applications.

## Room Guide

- **#welcome** - Company wide channel for general Q&A. Anyone in the company can post here, but you are not required to monitor or participate in the channel.
- **#general** - Company wide channel for official announcements. Only administrators can post in this channel. It is for official use and you are expected to monitor the channel.

## Recommendations for updates to our workflows

- Regularly purge dead or defunct channels with automation
- Develop some channel naming standardizations
  - team name-purpose
  - external to the name of any channel with access for guests
  - feed-(purpose)
    - Mostly for removing automated messages from channels
- Develop emoji as codes ?s for questions, checkboxes for request completions, polite racoon for out of topic changes
- Disable link previews?
- Create private channels not group DMs
- A #help channel
