# Project Management

## PM Responsibilities

The project manager / scrum master pod empowers, consults, and guides sprint teams working in the scrum framework, acting as scorekeeper, scrum coach, and servant-leader. Tasks include:

* Raise blocker visibility with team leads and facilitate resolution
* Schedule and facilitate scrum meetings, sprint reviews, retros, and reports
* Analyze achievable points in a sprint, using historical velocity and burndowns
* Track unplanned work and facilitate showstopper issues
* Facilitate sprint grooming, planning, and resourcing in consultation with product owners
* Day-to-day management of the scrum board
* Update completed work, and report the status of all work on a daily or weekly basis.
* Track work in ZenHub and Github, aligning and synchronizing with product roadmap in AHA.

The project manager / scrum master is not responsible for roadmap, resourcing, or technology decisions. The role is not a direct manager of engineers on the scrum team.

In addition to the above responsibilities, the PM/SM acts as an asset and champion for the pods and their leads.

* Facilitates the resolution of blockers, scheduling meetings, engaging stakeholders, assisting with issues, documentation etc.
* Coordinate and manage any sprint deliverables or reports that require input from the pod lead
* Adjust sprint capacity planning to account for PTO and administrative time
* Provide pods with data around sprint backlog planning and sizing

## Patterns We Seek
* Empowerment for pods working on problems directly relating to company goals
* Decision forks are surfaced, vetted collaboratively, and decided transparently
* Blockers that require input from various stakeholders have a predictable forum
* A written track record of decisions and deliverables
* Improved information-sharing channels between the engineering teams and other areas of the business
* Effective, streamlined meetings
* Continuous improvement of our products and processes

## Patterns We Avoid
* Silos or firewalls created between pods or functional roles
* Weighing down engineers with PM / admin overhead
* Ineffective, excessive Zoom meetings and/or inaccessible decisions
* Disparate time zones creating informational deficits
* "I donâ€™t know what to work on today"
