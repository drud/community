# Project Management
## SCRUM and RACI
When working with issues we use the concept of RACI to help identify the people that are involved. The RACI matrix [can be defined as](https://techblog.constantcontact.com/software-development/scrum-and-raci/):
- R - Responsible - These are the people who are responsible for doing the work.
- A - Accountable - This is the person responsible for the outcome and decision maker.
- C - Consultant - These people contribute to a decision being made (their input may or may not be agreed to).
- I - Informed - These people are informed about a decision but do not get input.
- F - Facilitator - These people help facilitate communication and information across the team.
