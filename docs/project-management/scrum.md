# Scrum

We want to support 2 simultaneous and related communication channels, each with a different audience and vocabulary. With a single standup, we struggle to fit 2 different meetings into one format or the other, leaving gaps for both.

- Business / Product / Marketing / Management
- Engineers and the scrum team(s) building the product

The business / product group requires a daily standup to work through blockers and open questions on roadmap and planning. Examples are: user stories and business requirements, OKR quarterly planning. This meeting should inform on priorities, timelines and deliverables. It should also provide a venue to flag product-level decisions requested from the engineering team.

In Q2 2020, a Scrum of Scrums standup was an attempt to address this, using pod leads. However, there was an unintended consequence of pods being disconnected, and a missing space for technical conversations and troubleshooting, which the previous engineering standup format allowed for. It also was at risk of becoming a `status update` meeting, which is not the intent of the scrum team standup.

Additionally, while the Geekbot written standup socializes everyone’s standup, it doesn’t create a predictable follow-up space for breakouts. It’s a lot of reading, every day. And we risk losing visibility on week-to-week, high-level goal progress (OKRs).

Lastly, scrum fails if it becomes too much of a management-driven process. The scrum team needs to be empowered to self-assess and continually improve its own processes, communications, and team-work. This is unlikely to happen if daily scrum meetings are run by or geared towards status reporting to management. There are other tools for this type of reporting within the scrum framework.

Consists of ET, product, marketing, sales, and project management.

Agenda:

- 9:00 - 9:15: Daily Standup on Zoom
  - Each participant gives a daily 3-question standup:
    - What have I completed since the last meeting?
    - What do I plan to complete by the next meeting?
    - What is blocking me?
- 9:15 - 9:30: Breakout.
  - Open discussion on sprint / OKR planning, sales opportunities, events, and product decisions flagged by engineering.
  - Business rule: decisions are documented in relevant Github or Asana issue.

**9:30 am - 10:00 AM MST: Daily Engineering Standup**

Standard scrum standup for engineers. All engineers are required to attend.

Agenda:

- 9:00 - 9:15: Daily Standup on Zoom
  - Each engineer gives a daily 3-question standup:
    - What have I completed since the last meeting?
    - What do I plan to complete by the next meeting?
    - What is blocking me?
- 9:45 - 10:00: Breakout.
  - Product / Business team joins
  - Business Rule: whoever is calling for breakout screen-shared the relevant Github issue with the meeting and is responsible for documenting any decisions made on the call on the issue, tagging relevant stakeholders on the issue.

## Fridays, weeks 1-2 of sprint. (no standups)

**9:00 am - 10:00 am MST: Weekly Review**

All-hands review of work completed during the week. Includes both the business and engineering units.

Agenda:

- Engineers bring WIP (or demos) that they need feedback on. 
- Collective review of OKR progress on the week
- Discuss and resolve blockers
- Revisit priorities for OKRs next week.

## Geekbot Reporting

We eliminate the daily standup form on Geekbot. Daily standups are handled verbally in their respective Zoom standups. Breakout decisions are recorded on their related issues. 

If people are going to miss the daily standup on Zoom, they are encourage to manually file a standup via Geekbot: direct message the Geekbot app with the command `report`.

**Thursday -> Friday**
- Every Thursday (due Friday by start of Weekly Review), there is a Geekbot OKR-focused report that is filled out by the team. It includes the questions:
  - What OKR-related tasks did I complete this week?
  - What other tasks did I complete this week?
  - What blockers did I run into?
  - What OKR-related tasks do I plan on working on next week?

**Mondays**
- Project Manager reviews Geekbot OKR reports
- Requests updates/changes to weekly goals, if needed
- Updates OKR reporting for Executive team and timelines in Board reporting spreadsheet
