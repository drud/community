# Scrum Process

We need to support 2 simultaneous and related communication channels, each with a different audience and vocabulary. We are struggling to fit 2 different meetings into one format or the other with both groups, leaving gaps for both.

- Business / Product / Marketing / Management
- Engineers and the scrum team(s) building the product

The business / product group needs more frequent daily comms to work through blockers and open questions on roadmap and planning. Examples are: user stories and business requirements, OKR quarterly planning. This meeting should inform on priorities, timelines and deliverables.

The Scrum of Scrums was an attempt to address this, using pod leads. However, it has perhaps resulted in pods being disconnected, lacking a space for technical conversations and troubleshooting (which the previous standup format allowed for). It is also at risk of becoming a 'status update' meeting which is not the intent of the scrum standup.

While the Geekbot standup socializes everyone’s standup, it doesn’t create a predictable follow-up space for breakouts. It’s a lot of reading, every day. And we’re struggling to get high-level goal progress broadly visible (OKRs).

Lastly, scrum fails if it becomes too much of a [management-driven process](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/29/does-scrum-ruin-great-engineers-or-are-you-doing-it-wrong/). The scrum team needs to be empowered to self-assess and continually improve its own processes, communications, and team-work. This is unlikely to happen if daily scrum meetings are run by or geared towards status reporting to management.

## Process Changes

There is a daily 9am Management / Business standup. This is focused on product, marketing, progress reports, roadmap, grooming etc. It consists of ET, product, marketing and project management. 

There is a daily 9:30 am engineering scrum standup. This is focused on the standard scrum standup and is engineer-only. All engineers attend.

At 9:45 am, management can optionally join the call to listen on breakouts and to answer product questions that have come up.

We eliminate the daily standup form on Geekbot. On Monday and Friday, there is a Geekbot weekly OKR-focused report that is filled out by all. It includes the questions:

Monday: 

- What OKR-related tasks do I plan to complete this week?
- What other work do I need to complete this week?

Friday: 

- What OKR-related tasks did I complete this week?
- What other tasks did I complete this week?
- What blockers did I run into?

Fridays there is no standup - instead there is a 9am - 10 all-hands review of work completed during the week. Engineers bring WIP (or demos) that they need feedback on. We collectively review OKR progress on the week and discuss any blockers.

Other Notes:

- On the last week of the sprint, the standup meetings are replaced on/with:
  - Wednesday: sprint review
  - Thursday: retrospective
  - Friday: sprint planning. (The product/business side is responsible for coming with a proposed sprint plan to this meeting).
- Eliminate the ops pod and features pod naming / separation this quarter
- As a management team, we are careful not to over-prescribe scrum team process or documentation. We support and empower them to solve problems within the team. We seek to strike a balance so that the business side gets the visibility it needs but the engineers don’t get frustrated by too much administrative overhead. 
- We prioritize getting the full team scrum training - business side and engineers
