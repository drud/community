# Technical Planning Docs
## Request for Comment
In the course of planning development, there are often scenarios where a technology or implementation decision fork is presented and an engineer wants to solicit ideas or feedback. 

Writing a full-blown Architectural Decision Record may not appropriate as that document requires significant overhead in proposing answers that still may be largely unknown.

Instead we use a Request for Comment markdown template that is more lightweight and speculative. It is designed to generate conversation and rapid feedback when there is not a clear solution with any level of certainty.

RFCs live in the ddev-live docs repo, alongside the ADR directory.

An RFC contains the following fields:
* The Problem
* Potential Solutions (if any)
* Areas of Potential Impact (on the platform, company etc.)
* How I Will Know Iâ€™ve Solved the Problem

The outcome of a RFC could be one or more of several paths.

* It could close with no action taken.
* It could solidify consensus around a proposed solution.
* It could lead to a spike of work to investigate further.
* It could generate the initial discovery for an ADR.
* It could lead to technical documentation.
